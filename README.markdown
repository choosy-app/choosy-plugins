# Choosy Plugins #

A future version of [Choosy](http://www.choosyosx.com) will support plugins, so that as well as opening URLs in browsers you can do all manner of other things with them.

This repository contains example plugins so that other developers can feedback on the general structure of plugins while the format is still in development.
